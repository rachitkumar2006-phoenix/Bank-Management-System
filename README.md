# Bank-Management-System
Developed my first-ever academic project, a menu-driven Bank Management System using the C programming language. The system supports essential banking operations such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, balance enquiry, account search, and account deletion. Real-time date and time feature was also integrated to display transaction timestamps.
