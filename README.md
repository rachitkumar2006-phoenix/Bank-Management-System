# Bank-Management-System
Developed my first-ever academic project, a menu-driven Bank Management System using the C programming language. The system supports essential banking operations such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, balance enquiry, account search, and account deletion. File handling was implemented to store and manage account records persistently across program executions. A real-time date and time feature was also integrated to display transaction timestamps. This project served as a strong foundation for understanding structured programming, file handling, and logical problem-solving in C.
